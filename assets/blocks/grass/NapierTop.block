 * Napier grass, also known as elephant grass, is a tall variety of grass
 * which grows in the African savannah. It is a favorite food of pachyderms,
 * thus the name "elephant grass", and is often grown outside of farms as a
 * "pull crop" to attract insect pests that would otherwise eat more useful plants.
